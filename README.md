# Merdad Karkudi HTMLcodeRefactor


Merdad Homework 1


This homework is about to change some code in html and CSS along with added comments to make strong search abilities for the webpage that we are working on. there are several advantages that we can get from these changes. Here are some changes that I have done on in this page. added "alt" for images to be clearer for myself and the other coders. added "comments" for changes to be clear why and what have been changed. added "title" and changed the title to be more reliable for Users and Operators. added some semantic html tags. What happens when you are adding all these semantics HTML elements to your page? Here is the answer; The browser going to do 2 things: 1- It is going to generate a visible user interface. 2- It is going to take all semantic information and create what’s called the accessibility tree. And that accessibility tree then gets handed off to assistive technology like screen reader, like voiceover, or like NVDA. these changes can help the company to get more views and get better search results and it's easier access to the web materials for all users.
